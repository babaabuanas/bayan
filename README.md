 # what is the HTML Langage ?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the basic structural element that is used to create webpages. HTML is a markup language, which means that it is used to “mark up” the content within a document, in this case a webpage, with structural and semantic information that tells a browser how to display a page. When an HTML document is loaded by a web browser, the browser uses the HTML tags that have marked up the document to render the page’s content.

There are three types of code that make up a basic website page. HTML governs the structural elements, CSS styles those elements, and JavaScript enables dynamic interaction between those elements

# Basic HTML Page Structure

A basic HTML page is a document that typically has the file extension .html, though HTML frequently appears in the content of other file types as well. All HTML documents follow the same basic structure so that the browser that renders the file knows what to do. The basic structure on which all webpages are built looks like this

# Elements and Tags

HTML elements and tags work together to mark up content. HTML elements indicate the purpose of a tag and tags indicate the beginning and the end of an element.

For example, here is a simple paragraph in HTML:

The letter “p” represents the paragraph element. In this example, <p> is an opening tag that tells the browser that the content that follows it is a paragraph. The slash in the second tag, </p>, indicates that it is a closing tag that tells the browser that the paragraph element is ending and that any content that appears after it is not part of the paragraph. You may encounter serious display issues if you don’t remember to “close” each tag because the browser will interpret this pattern as meaning that the element identified by the opening tag should continue for the rest of the page.

# Body- Head and Title
*Body tag :Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.*
*Head tag :This contains information about the page rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window*
*title tag :The contents of the title element are either shown in the top of the browser.*

# Page layout

is the part of graphic design that deals with the arrangement of visual elements on a page. Page layout is used to make the web pages look better. It establishes the overall appearance, relative importance, and relationships between the graphic elements to achieve a smooth flow of information and eye movement for maximum effectiveness or impact.
For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes  
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.
 
 # HTML 5
HTML 5 is the current version of HTML which is used. “We’ve come a long way since HTML could barely handle a simple page layout. HTML5 can be used to write web applications that still work when you’re not connected to the net; to tell websites where you are physically located; to handle high definition video; and to deliver extraordinary graphics.” (Marshall, 2017). HTML 5 continues to evolve and is supported by all of the biggest browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Opera and Edge.
HTML has come very far since the first version (HTML 1.0), which only offered simple features meaning most webpages looked very similar. Since then the W3 Consortium has been established, css has been created, more features are supported by browsers and in general, more can be done with HTML. This means there’s less confusion, universal standards and ease of use. HTML is constantly progressing and changing — in a few decades, we can expect that HTML will have advanced even further
